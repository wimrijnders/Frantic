# TODO
#
# - Attacking collective: if only blocked by non-water, stay instead of evade.
# - Staying put is a good strategy for small playing fields.
# - 1-x ant combat; best approach is diagonal on corner ant. You die but you also kill one enemy.
# - On evasion, select shortest route (fast-forward?)
# - Break off evasion if under attack for collectives
# - Creating collectives: don't do it in the direct neighbourhood of water (fixed obstacles) 
#
# - URGENT! collective attack: 
#		- break flip-flop deadlock 
#		- detect ants which ignore you and keep on going in the same direction
#		- defensive: detect inert enemies, these render you immobile.
#
# - If attacked with no way of escape, defend as well as possible
#		- if ant is sure to die, let him take an enemy down
# - Retreat: for multiple attackers, select good escape route
#
# - BUG: Following appearing in the logs:
#
#   - 87756: collective3 ( 55, 82 ) relpos count: 3, orient: n # unknown action
#
#   Ie. one member too many TODO: Fix
#
# DOING
#
# - URGENT: Timeout problem because of sorting enemy ants.
#            TODO: NEEDS TO BE FIXED
#
# - Assembling collective: if new ants are made closer by than assembling ants,
#     use these new ants instead
#     	- ideal case: in exact necessary position
